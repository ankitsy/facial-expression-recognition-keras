# facial-expression-recognition-keras
A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based facial expression recognition model with 65.62% accuracy. The state-of-the-art model acheived an accuracy of 73.11% on this dataset.

#### Main Objective:
For human beings, understanding expressions is a very easy task. But the same cannot be said for the computers. Even though there has been a tremendous growth in the Machine Learning/ AI field such that computers are proved to be more accurate than humans in a lot of tasks related to computer vision, NLP and many more. But for a computer to interpret the facial expressions has still been a difficult task for computers. In this project, we will construct a model that can interpret the facial expressions.

#### About the Dataset:
We will be using the famous FER2013 dataset (link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset. The data consists of 35k 48x48 pixel images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral).
